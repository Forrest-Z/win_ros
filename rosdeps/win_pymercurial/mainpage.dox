\section Status

 - Downloads version 2.1.1
 - Builds an msi installer (build/???)
 - Will build against whatever python you currently have.
 - By default builds a 'pure' python version of hg.

\section Optional

You can get it to compile binaries (thus faster) by doing the following.

 - Install ms express or visual studio (windows sdk7.1 won't cut it)
 - Start a shell with the vsvarsall.bat loaded, e.g.
 
@code
call C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat
@endcode
 
 - Run 'make compiled'

\section Other

 - See make.bat for more details.
