\section Current Status

 - Downloads version 3.3
 - Builds an msi installer (build/empy-3.3/dist/empy-3.1.win32.msi)
 - Will compile against whatever python you currently have.

See make.bat for details.

\section Issues

Actually sets the version as 3.1 when it's really 3.3. Not a big drama though.
See setup.py where he's obviously forgotten to upgrade the version number.
