== UDP Bug ==

The combo talker + listener_unreliable fails, somewhere forming the connection, it mangles the header. Some debugging output:

On listener_unreliable's side:

    Subscription::negotiateConnection writing 118 bytes.
        callerid=/listener_unreliable'    md5sum=992ce8a1687cec8c8bd883ec73ca41d1    topic=/chatter    type=std_msgs/String

On talker's side:
    TopicManager::requestTopic received a type UDPROS
    TopicManager::requestTopic header bytes 118
        ca le id /l st ne _u re ia le     md su =9 2c 8a 68 ce 8c bd 83 c7 ca 1d     t pi =/ ha ter    t pe st _m gs St in 

There's a pattern there, every third byte is missing, but I've no idea why.

THIS HAS BEEN FIXED.
