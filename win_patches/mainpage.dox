\section Overview

Nothing to see here - no code...well, except for patches to get ros working on windows
until those patches are accepted upstream.

\section Patches

 - ros_comm_chrono, rostime_chrono : boost 1.50 (mingw) now needs chrono below thread...make sure to add them
  - not upstreaming this one as its a way off yet and needs a better fix than dropping the required while both boosts are supported
 - actionlib_msgs_installation_path : fix to avoid mashing two full paths together.
  - https://github.com/ros/genmsg/pull/5
 - common_msgs_actionlib_absolute_path : fix absolute path checking for windows.
  - https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5504 
 - actionlib_boost_dependencies : link boost dependences it actually uses so catkin can build.
  - https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/5499
 - avoid_forking_roslaunch.patch : experimental hack to work around the fact that windows cant track its children
 - roslaunch_popen_shells.patch : lets us use .bat scripts to call python code and execute via popen.
  - not committing upstream yet as using shells is considered a security problem
